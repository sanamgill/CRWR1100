Course</h1><p>Creative Writing 1240 is a class about digital creativity. We explore tools and processes for writing on the web, such as <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>. We focus on helping writers cultivate effective platforms for online creative expression. <br />The class is taught by <a href="https://www.rosslaird.com">Ross Laird</a> at <a href="https://www.kpu.ca">Kwantlen Polytechic University</a>.<p>The contemporary age is one of tremendous upheaval and uncertainty for the literary arts. New technologies challenge established business practices. Nascent and rapidly emerging markets pose new questions about processes and products. Conflicted conversations about rights and the uses of creative commodity dominate an increasingly fractured landscape. this turbulent tumble lies the writer as artist: pressured by the exigencies of commerce, burdened by the minutiae of intellectual property law, increasingly hobbled by anxiety and disorientation.<p>The writer now feels at the whim of indifferent and unpredictable forces. The buffers which once protected professional writers from the messiness and incipient momentum of the market are now, for the most part, dismantled or disintegrating. Creative and professional paths that once were secure are now fraught with new obstacles. The sacred space of creative inquiry seems under threat. The artifacts of that inquiry have lost much of their meaning. The casual blog has vanquished the thoughtful book.<p>At least, this is how it seems to many writers working today: dark times, enemies at the gate. But this is how all the great stories begin. Turbulence – emotional, cultural, political – is the source and fuel of creativity. The current age is thus a great gift. Artists and writers are now free, in the philosophical (and perhaps spiritual) sense, free to pursue the clamour and craft of their work, in a manner that we have not encountered before. Not since the audacious invention of writing itself. Creative Writing 1240 invites writers to discover – or rediscover – the unrivaled adventure of creative work in the world today. The path forward is not labyrinthine but requires, rather – like most daunting tasks – that a small number of simplicities reveal themselves behind the swirl of turbulence. Course participants will learn about various technologies of creativity – this, of course, is a pertinent and pressing matter – but the course workshop is not, primarily, another introduction to blogging, social networking, web content, and viral marketing. These are only the outer appearance – the carapace, the shell – of what amounts to a re-imagining of what it means to be a creative person in the world today.<p>Creative Writing 1240 is a course about reclaiming the fundamental right of creative endeavour and choosing the paths that lead forward.<p>Freedom, adventure, opportunity: these are the watchwords of the contemporary creative professional. Every age calls its inhabitants to action. How do we know this? Writers tell us. How do they tell us? By facing their own crises of confidence, by wrestling with the emerging norms and practices of their time, by seizing the word as their instrument and their stand. Why should we expect our age to be any different? Why would we want it to be?<h3 id="learning-experiences">Learning Experiences</h3><p>The course will include a variety of learning experiences contingent upon regular attendance and dedicated participation. Because creative inquiry is an interactive process, much of the class time will be devoted to group experiential exercises, individual reflective tasks, collaborative endeavors, and practical assignments.<p>We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are not going to cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts and education: competitive, cut-throat, critical. Instead, we will direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each participant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing our work together, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity of our contributions. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile, especially at its inception, and we must be conscious of this fragility. Think about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers? Why do you think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or drawing, or reading their written work to others? We have, most of us, been the victims of inappropriate feedback and judgment. We have to be careful about this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.<h4 id="skill-development">Skill Development</h4><p>Perhaps it’s most helpful to come at creative writing in terms of a skill set. Thinking and acting creatively is really a matter of looking at the process of learning. Instead of focusing on the “content” we might ask questions about how we identify, interpret, create, and communicate this content. These are process questions. Below are some examples of the kinds of considerations we will explore during our process.<h5 id="creating-a-good-question">Creating a “Good” Question</h5><p>The questions we ask tell us a lot about how we think, the assumptions we make and what we’re willing to accept as answers. What is a “good” question? How do questions emerge? Where do they come from? How does a creative question evolve? How do we hold space for our questions and how do they “work” on us? We will discuss these questions about questions, and see where they lead us.<h5 id="critical-thinking-and-crap-detection">Critical Thinking and Crap Detection</h5><p>We are often quick to believe what we read and what we hear, especially when it comes from sources that we deem “authoritative.” Teachers, journal articles, media, books, professors, parents, and peers all have their own take on what is correct and true. Who is right? How do we know what we’re hearing is not false or misconstrued? What is true? From what perspective is it true? What other perspectives can be taken that are also true? What evidence is being used to support the claim? Is the evidence appropriate for the kind of claim being made? What ideologies, assumptions and beliefs are at play? How do they impact the interpretation of “facts”? And what are facts, anyway?<h5 id="finding-using-and-evaluating-resources">Finding, Using and Evaluating Resources</h5><p>Resources are what we use to accomplish something. We have internal resources such as courage, empathy, compassion, self-awareness, mindfulness and so on to help us create, learn and work with the challenges of life. People in our lives such as teachers, peers, mentors, and guides also have skills, experience, and knowledge that can potentially help us accomplish our goals. As well, the internet, books and other sources of information are valuable resources. How do we know what resources we need to accomplish a goal? Are they internal, interpersonal, or codified? What are the means by which we access these resources? How do we know if the sources we’re accessing are good or the right ones for our goal? How do we evaluate their quality?<h5 id="communication-speaking-listening-writing-performing">Communication (speaking, listening, writing, performing)</h5><p>Language is expressed verbally and non-verbally in a particular relational context of culture, values and past experience. Our ability to translate ideas into words and actions, move an audience into a compelling dialogue, or simply be present to someone else, requires an awareness of these contexts and good communication skills. How does a mindful and embodied presence shape how we speak and listen? How do we write articulately, persuasively, and with accuracy and authenticity? How do our values shape the way we communicate?<h5 id="working-in-a-group">Working in a Group</h5><p>Groups offer invaluable opportunities for personal development and routinely transcend the efforts of any one individual. The following elements are some of the important capabilities required for healthy group process:<ul><li>building trust and a culture of collaboration<li>attending to individual needs and the needs of the group<li>sharing responsibility<li>giving and receiving feedback<li>embracing and resolving minor conflicts</ul><p>Much of our class time will be spent in small and large groups exploring and developing these skills.<h5 id="following-through-on-a-process">Following Through on a Process</h5><p>Any creative process that generates new forms of knowledge (arts, sciences and otherwise) typically has a number of phases. These phases don’t always happen in order and are not necessarily distinct events, but it’s helpful to think about the ecocycle of creative work. First, there is the discovery of interest or passion. The question or idea may not even be fully formed at this point, but there’s a spark that feels like it’s worth following. Next, we immerse ourselves in the topic. We read, have conversations, mess with different approaches. Basically, we commit to learning as much as we can about our passion. At some point we have consciously consumed as much as we can about the topic and we need a break from thinking about it. We let the questions incubate and trust that they are working under the surface in the dark soil. “Spring” eventually comes, perhaps after a long “winter”. Insights and breakthroughs emerge. Little shoots pop up out of the soil. We are careful to not jump to conclusions but instead create space for ideas and insights to slowly emerge through a process of articulating and capturing. In the last stages, we bring all the elements together in a creative synthesis and share the bounty of our harvest.<p>What is happening at each stage of the creative process? What are the challenges of each stage? How do we support the work that needs to be done in each phase? How do we manage our time in such a way that we are able to do creative work sustainably? Doing the preparatory work, looking for and taking opportunities, experimenting, being realistic about time, taking care of mind/body/heart/soul, and attending to other responsibilities all require good skills in managing our time. And how do we balance these various factors?<h5 id="self-awareness-and-self-evaluation">Self-Awareness and Self-Evaluation</h5><p>Growing personally and professionally is a process that has no end point. Although growth is challenging and at times painful, growth is critical to finding meaning and vitality in our life and work. Living systems that come to an equilibrium with their environment — that stick with the status quo and are content living in their comfort zone — do not live for very long! For humans, growth requires self-evaluation, which in turn involves looking at our strengths and vulnerabilities, considering the evidence and feedback in these areas, identifying where we wish to grow, creating a game plan for how we plan to address our vulnerabilities, and celebrating our successes.<p>Self-assessment involves asking questions such about how we wish to grow. What is involved in growing in a given area? What opportunities can we find and/or create to grow? How do we take responsibility for working on ourselves? How does the feedback from others and the results of our attempts to develop tell us how we are doing? How do we decide what to do with the feedback we receive from others?<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4><p>This is a writing course. Accordingly, you will write something. The minimum length of your final composition is 3,000 words. You will create this composition in several stages, from rough draft to final polish. Each stage will be graded. You may write more than 3,000 words, if you like. There is no maximum. Your composition will be included in the digital portfolio of the class and will appear online at a public-access website.<p>Your composition can be in any genre and on any topic you choose. The goal is to choose a subject about which you are passionate and to write in a form and style that best further your literary passion. The compositions will be discussed in detail in class.<p>The composition assignment (in four stages, each worth 25 percent) is worth 100 percent of your grade.<h4 id="assessment-criteria-for-the-creative-compositions">Assessment Criteria for the Creative Compositions</h4><p>Projects for this course are focused on authentic and creative inquiry. Accordingly, the following criteria – which are based on the philosophy of creative inquiry – are used to evaluate engagement and commitment to the individual project:<ul><li>Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.<li>Willingness to try new things, especially when doing so provokes discomfort.<li>Openness to personal and interpersonal process.<li>Willingness to collaborate with others.<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.<li>Ability to take personal responsibility and initiative for learning.<li>Willingness to approach academic inquiry as a skill with discrete steps and standards.<li>Commitment to improvement in writing and creative work.<li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</ul><p>In addition to the above criteria, compositional criteria are also used to evaluate your writing, as follows (in percentages):<h5 id="80100">80 − 100</h5><p>Excellent: the use of language is pleasing and vigorous. The writing invites reading; the work is well-crafted and grammatically flawless. The author is perceptive.<h5 id="7679">76 − 79</h5><p>Very good: the use of language is generally correct. There may be a need for further editing. This could be in the presentation of the work (style, voice, characterisation, plot, point of view), or in the language (diction, grammar, usage, spelling, punctuation) — but the writing is involving.<h5 id="7275">72 − 75</h5><p>Good: the author has created a composition with substantial content and without any serious errors in tone or narration. Problems with creative shaping and delivery may occur, and there may be a further need for learning the mechanics of language use, but generally, the problems do not interfere with the reader’s appreciation of the work.<h5 id="6871">68 − 71</h5><p>Compositions with repeated errors in grammar, usage or punctuation will result in a grade of no higher than 71 regardless of the proficiency and imagination demonstrated in the creative aspects of the work. On the other hand, compositions with no problems in grammar, usage or punctuation may not receive a grade higher than 71 if they fail to demonstrate an understanding of the challenges (of style or voice, for example) involved in writing in the genre.<h5 id="6467">64 − 67</h5><p>Satisfactory: this writing shows constrained use of language (either in the creative shaping and delivery of content or in repeated errors in grammar punctuation, diction and usage), and the treatment of the material has not resulted in sufficient depth. The writing is potentially interesting, and a revision may improve the composition.<h5 id="6063">60 − 63</h5><p>This meets the minimum criteria of the assignment without in any way exceeding it. There are repeated errors such as spelling mistakes, sloppiness or a lack of depth to the writing.<h5 id="5659">56 − 59</h5><p>Below average: the writing is difficult to read because of inappropriate delivery or repeated grammatical errors or both. Furthermore, the idea may not be appropriate for the form. This grade does not permit students to pursue another course for which the graded course was a prerequisite.<h5 id="5055">50 − 55</h5><p>Fail: the author fails to understand the nature of creative writing or has not tried.<h4 id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and Participation</h4><p>The expectation is that you will attend all sessions and involve yourself in the class process. Your willingness to engage creatively with the learning process, to take appropriate personal risks, and to participate in group activities are all central to your involvement in this class. Because developing a style of authentic creative inquiry is very much a process of blending your own personal awareness with skills and practical techniques, your own emotional involvement in the class is as important as your academic knowledge of the material.<p>It’s easy to identify those who possess exemplary interpersonal and creative skills. They are relaxed, open, responsive, kind (Jacob Bronowski is probably the best modern example). Often they exhibit skills that we tend to assign to the social sphere: personal warmth, consideration of others, hesitancy to judge, sensitivity to emotions. In our class we focus on these interpersonal factors as a foundation for our experiences with one another. And we itemize them as features along the continuum of self-awareness:<ul><li>Commitment to the development of self-awareness.<li>Openness to interpersonal process.<li>Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.<li>Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the class.<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.<li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.<li>Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.<li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</ul><p>Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item: self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:<ul><li>What am I feeling right now?<li>What am I thinking right now?<li>Why am I reacting in this particular way?<li>What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?<li>Is there anything about my current behavior that suggests unresolved themes in my life?<li>Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?<li>When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?<li>In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?</ul><p>These questions, and many others, require the capacity for self-reflection and self-awareness. As we continue in the course, you may wish to consider these questions as they apply to you.<h3 id="general-suggestions-for-the-grade-anxious">General Suggestions for the Grade-Anxious</h3><p>If you wish to achieve a good grade, please do the following:<ul><li>Show up for class – every class. This course depends on student engagement.<li>Contribute consistently to the creative community and respond to the contributions of others.<li>Be attentive and mindful to the various criteria listed for each of the projects and the course overall.<li>Take the initiative to plan and develop your compositions. This course is (very likely) more fluid and spontaneous than you are used to. Your ability to manage your time, commitment, and energy is crucial.<li>Speak up in every class.<li>Don’t look for the right answer to a question or challenge. Instead, find the answer that is meaningful to you.<li>Ask for help if you need it.<li>Commit to your project in a substantial way. Good projects take time. Rushed projects are obviously rushed.</ul><p>Finally, please be attentive to the <a href="https://www.kpu.ca/policies">KPU policies</a> on academic honesty and plagiarism.<h3 id="due-dates">Due Dates</h3><p>Compositions will be evaluated every three weeks, with the final submission due in week twelve.<h3 id="thematic-schedule">Thematic Schedule</h3><p>The class sessions will be balanced between presentations, academic material, group collaboration, and composition.
