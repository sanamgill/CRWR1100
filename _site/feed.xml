&lt;p&gt;Hydejack offers a few additional features to markup your markdown.
Don’t worry, these are merely &lt;abbr title=&quot;Cascading Style Sheets&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/abbr&gt; classes added via the standard &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:.my-class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax,
so that your posts remain compatible with other Jekyll themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: For an introduction to markdown in general, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/&quot;&gt;Mastering Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html&quot;&gt;kramdown Syntax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-message-boxes&quot;&gt;Adding message boxes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add a message box by adding the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; class to a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: You can add a message box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-markdown highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gs&quot;&gt;**NOTE**&lt;/span&gt;: You can add a message box.
{:.message}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-large-text&quot;&gt;Adding large text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add large text by adding the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lead&lt;/code&gt; class to the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;You can add large text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-markdown highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;You can add large text.
{:.lead}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-large-images&quot;&gt;Adding large images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make an image span the full width by adding the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lead&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://placehold.it/800x100&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-markdown highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;![&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Full-width image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;https://placehold.it/800x100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;{:.lead}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-large-quotes&quot;&gt;Adding large quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make a quote “pop out” by adding the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lead&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can make a quote “pop out”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; You can make a quote &quot;pop out&quot;.
{:.lead}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-faded-text&quot;&gt;Adding faded text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can gray out text by adding the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;faded&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this sparingly and for information that is not essential
— or you don’t want viewers to read at all, like when you pull a line form a dirty rap song..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;faded&quot;&gt;I’m faded, faded, faded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-md highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;I'm faded, faded, faded.
{:.faded}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Close your email application and
Facebook, turn off the background music, silence your cell phone. Put
it all away. Do it now. I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sit in silence, without distraction, and read this post. Silence the
part of you that makes false claims about the utility of background
music or the necessity of leaving your cell phone turned on. Silence
the part of you that wants to argue with me, right now, about my
unreasonableness, the part of you that makes claims for this or that
distraction. Still the monkey mind that never shuts up, never stops
talking, never ceases inventing new ways to jostle, cajole,
argue. Stop arguing and listen: the voice of a writer can only be
found within silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with that. Stay within it. Allow it to grow around you, to
blossom, to disclose the images and words that inhabit the landscape
of your inner life. Don’t control it, or direct the flow of that
nascent energy. Sit, and read, and watch yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget that you are trying to write. This fact is irrelevant to the
creative process. It is a curiosity. A writer finds and follows the
creative voice. The means by which this happens, the structure in
which it unfolds, the particulars of the path: these are secondary and
inconsequential. A writer follows the path, whenever it appears and
wherever it leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A writer does not invent or create the writing. Instead, the act of
authentic writing leads the writer. Accordingly, the task of the
writer is to find – within – the stream, thread, and path of creative
energy. Writing inhabits its own life, is its own animal, is a being
struggling to be free of the cages we build around it. Don’t take my
word for it. Find the cage, find the animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop arguing. Your arguments, like mine, only serve to strengthen the
cage. The animal of the creative is not swayed by our smartness, our
wit, our experiences. It does not care how many books we have read or
how many fancy words we know. It is not interested in our expertise
and the many ways in which we layer our insecurities one over the
other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animal of the creative wanders the landscape of gods and
heroes. The animal has seen things we no longer remember. The animal
is what we once were but have chosen to cage as a means of protecting
ourselves from the vastness of what we cannot grasp, the depths into
which we no longer dare to gaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creative animal is primordial, eternal, wise beyond our
knowing. It has been waiting for us, all this time. Listen to what it
has to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow the creative animal to write for you one good word, or sentence,
or paragraph. Don’t mess up the writing. It is difficult to say what
this means, this messing up. Perhaps you are cool, or smart, or
erudite. Forget all that crap. It is meaningless. Write honestly. Let
the creative animal speak through you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, as you write, you start to worry about what people might think of
your writing, you may as well not start. Give it up now, before you
waste any more time. Or tell the part of you that wants to be a rabbit
rather than a wolf to shut the hell up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write something. Don’t worry about what genre it is. Genres have no
meaning. Writing — all writing — is, at heart, an extended negotiation
with the creative animal. That animal is partly you, yes; but is also
not you, is wholly an emissary of that mystery we run from and slide
toward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the animal is — for the most part — silent. Do not forget
this. Words are not the creative, cannot be the creative, will never
be the creative. They are echoes. Treat them as such. Find the source
of those echoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the cage. Find the animal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ross Laird</name><email>ross@rosslaird.com</email></author><category term="mindfulness" /><summary type="html">Stop whatever else you are doing.

and branches of all literature – are articulated visions. They are
dreams, glimpses of other worlds (real or imagined), archetypes of
clear seeing. This clarity of vision defines good literature, and is
therefore the ultimate aim of practicing writers. Yet various
impediments arise to obscure our sight, the way a bank of low-lying
cloud hides a shoreline glistening with pebbles. As writers, sometimes
we become disoriented by the many conflicting tools of our craft, by
contrary examples and advice, by the spinning compasses of style and
voice. Our path becomes uncertain, the shore distant, vision muddied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet the shore is not far, and reaching it requires only a
steadfast purpose; and, of course, awareness of the fog. To dispel
that fog we must avoid its common traps, which are our own habits in
disguise. Below are the most common. Find them in your work, excise
them, clear your vision.  Tip 1: Use concrete imagery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer is a ruminative animal (like a cow, in fact). We chew over
our lives and histories, we digest and express the stories to which we
are drawn. This process requires a good deal of thought. Writers think
– cogitate speculate, perambulate – and we write down our
thoughts. Yet we forget, often, that the reader does not have access
to our mind, does not perceive the interconnections and contexts which
lead us to our conclusions. We must show the reader that context, the
web of threads and images by which we derive our narratives. And this
requires that we replace our inner ruminations with concrete imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its own, unaccompanied by imagery, I am sad is poor writing. The
reader is offered no means by which to understand the cause or nature
of the sadness. The writer must provide the path to understanding by
way of imagery. Typically, the rule for this situation involves four
or five concrete images for each internal rumination. Like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheets of rain strike the window. I gaze into the dark, searching for
the glimmer of proud trees across the field. Too dark to see
anything. The house, empty now, twists and groans in the sidelong
wind. Every whisper of its movement reminds me of the sad night ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above passage, sad is embedded within imagery, layered,
integrated. It is not a rumination but a concrete indication of
feeling. And it comes in the last of five sentences, thus proving the
rule. This rule also has another name: Show, Don’t Tell.  Tip 2: Use
the present tense&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when writing about the past, the present tense is usually the
best route to clarity. Other tenses and moods require more words,
encourage abstraction, and introduce a barrier between the immediacy
of the reader and the distance of the text. These problems are most
evident when writers use the subjunctive mood (or tense), which is
defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subjunctive: a mood that represent an act or state (not as a fact but)
as contingent or possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, the subjunctive mood uses words such as if, that,
though, lest, unless, except, until and so on. But in a more general
way, the subjunctive mood, or tense, might be described as any writing
that removes the reader from the concrete and present tense:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish my dog were here.  If Dave were stronger, he would have been
able to lift the tree stump.  If I had paid more attention to my
instructor’s tips about creative writing, I would be a better writer.
I requested that John be present at the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above examples illustrate various ways in which subjunctive
approaches to writing introduce extra words and awkward
phrases. Replacing these with concrete phrases in the present tense
improves the writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dog is here.  Dave is not strong enough the lift the stump.  I
listen to my creative writing instructor.  My writing improves.  John
comes to the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a short list of words and phrases that often accompany writing
that meanders away from the present tense and from concrete
imagery. Avoid these words and phrases whenever possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there would/could, were/was, has/had, those/these, that/this Tip 3:
Avoid adverbs and gerunds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gerund is a noun formed from a verb: walking, for example. Gerunds
usually end in ing, and avoiding them is one of the single most
positive changes a writer can make. Gerunds are problematic for two
reasons: they encourage adverbs and they drift toward abstraction (see
tips one and two).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a writer may describe a scene of walking as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was walking down the street, quickly, not paying too much attention
to the hurtling traffic and the shop-keepers shouting stridently from
their stalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vignette is neither in the present tense (and is therefore less
concrete than it might be) nor is it crisp and clear enough. As soon
as the writer begins with the gerund walking, all the other adverbs
and gerunds in the sentence follow naturally; awkwardly and
naturally. Gerunds, therefore, imply adverbs and abstraction. Also,
gerunds require more words and tenses: was walking requires two words
to state a simple verb. Here’s how to reduce the confusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk down the street. My steps are quick, my attention wanders. I do
not notice the hurtling traffic, nor the shouts of strident
shop-keepers as I pass their stalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised passage is more immediate, possesses an air of expectation
(of suspense, almost), is constructed with precision, and contains no
extra words. The revision begins with a present tense action: I walk
down the street. The remainder of the passage builds naturally,
preserves the original clarity. Better. Stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like gerunds, adverbs – typically words that end in ly – introduce
abstraction and encourage awkward phrasings. An adverb qualifies a
verb, limits or augments the verbal meaning. As such, an adverb serves
the same function as a bank of fog laid across a shoreline. The fog
obscures, mediates, filters. Almost always, adverbs may be replaced
with more accurate verbs and fewer words; as in the example above,
with the adverb quickly replaced by the verb quick and a concrete
image of the steps of the walker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerunds and adverbs are not always avoidable. They are necessary at
times, and need not be shunned entirely. But often they are lazy
solutions. Avoid them whenever feasible.  Tip 4: Tune your vocabulary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is not speech. And yet the habits of speech tend to infiltrate
writing. Resist this whenever possible: look for these infiltrations,
replace them with narrative structures, preserve the clarity of your
vision. For example, I am not a farmer, and I do not eat broccoli is
better than I’m not a farmer, and I don’t eat broccoli. Apostrophes
derive from speech, and are usually to be avoided in writing (except
in the case of possessives, obviously). In similar fashion, it is best
to limit the use, in writing, of the following common and
conversational words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;really, very, it, quite, real, some, somehow, someone, something,
everything, thing, anyone, maybe, little, been, your, never, always,
only, just, deep, people, about, being, guess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary of a writer need not be coruscating or arcane or
hermetic. Small and common words will do, and in most cases should
do. Small words encourage precision and clarity. The order of such
words, the manner in which they are structured as narrative and not as
speech, determines much of the quality of writing.  Tip 5: Know your
habits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the various strategies outlined above, writers also
need to be aware of their individual proclivities: their habits of
laziness, their favorite and over-used words, the ways in which they
sacrifice clarity for muddiness. The following are the most common
secondary errors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Awkward phrase order in compound sentences

Awkward shifts of scene or tense

Awkward use of vocabulary

Lack of clear narrative direction

Stating the obvious rather than showing through imagery
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These habits and their kin – the many pitfalls and hurdles that lie
along the path of writing – are avoided only through practice. Go
slow, review each sentence as you write, make a list of your common
errors and search for each error as you compose. Remember the primary
goal: clarity.  Tip 6: Build Sentences Step by Step&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s easier to break things into manageable steps. Here are
some steps to consider in starting your compositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sit comfortably. Turn down thoughts. Relax. Enter into a
contemplative mood.

Consider what you are trying to express in the sentence you are
about to write.

Write the sentence. At this stage, don’t worry about
details. Simply write.

Review the sentence. Look for obvious problems, and find what you
like most.

Make sure your sentence contains the best words for what you are
trying to say.

Examine the phrase order. Look for a tighter order, more spare or
visceral or elegant.

Speak the sentence aloud. Find its rhythm and sonority. Tweak as
required. Don’t rush.

Take out all extra words and lazy phrasings, especially those that
are habitual. Excise adverbs, gerunds, and verb phrases (&quot;there
is...&quot;, &quot;I’ve done...&quot;, &quot;We’re going...&quot;) whenever possible.

Shorten the sentence if you can (without diminishing its meaning).

Take a short break, gaze out the window, return to the sentence,
and review it once more.

Leave it alone. Build your next sentence.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

They are dreams, glimpses of other worlds (real or imagined), archetypes of clear seeing. This clarity of vision defines good literature, and is therefore the ultimate aim of practicing writers. Yet various impediments arise to obscure our sight, the way a bank of low-lying cloud hides a shoreline glistening with pebbles. As writers, sometimes we become disoriented by the many conflicting tools of our craft, by contrary examples and advice, by the spinning compasses of style and voice. Our path becomes uncertain, the shore distant, vision muddied.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Problems: Small Wonder</title><link href="crwr1240.github.io/education/2016/11/13/big-problems-small-wonder/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Problems: Small Wonder" /><published>2016-11-13T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2016-11-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>crwr1240.github.io/education/2016/11/13/big-problems-small-wonder</id><content type="html" xml:base="crwr1240.github.io/education/2016/11/13/big-problems-small-wonder/">&lt;p&gt;Got a minute?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try this small but illuminating experiment. Below is an image of the Milky Way Galaxy. Focus your attention on this image for one minute. Don’t do anything other than look at the image. I know, your time is valuable and this is a big ask. One minute of sustained attention is a long time on the web. But see if you can do it. I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/3096817-Milky_Way_panorama_large.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Milky Way&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent. I’d like you now to take a moment to reflect on your experience. What kinds of thoughts went through your mind? Did you wonder why I am asking you do to this? Did you have the impulse to click or tap around? Did you experience anxiety or other emotions? Were you unable to complete the experiment? A universe of possibilities lies hidden within that single minute. Let’s explore that universe a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience of a single minute’s worth of unscripted attention might be described as mental wandering, or what these days is often called the default mode. It’s typically a moment of non-action, a small sliver of undirected time, in which you might be ambling along the beach or gazing at a star field. Most of us don’t actively seek moments of wandering these days. Instead, we constantly choose the path of endless distraction and activity. We don’t slow down, we don’t pause to look around, and consequently we don’t open ourselves to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a problem, and here’s why: moments of wandering and meandering cultivate wonder. And, in turn, the search for wonder is the source of most of our greatest achievements. The histories of all the arts and sciences are filled with stories of great moments of wonder gleaned from small, meandering, directionless moments. Wonder is a direct encounter with mystery. That encounter is the source of all of our growth and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do those moments typically occur? There are many paths to wonder, but the most common are directionless walking, gazing – as we have done, in looking at the Milky Way – and bathing. The story of Archimedes making a great scientific discovery in the bath – and shouting Eureka! – is a good (and probably apocryphal) example of this pattern. The history of science includes many similar examples of discovery while meandering, gazing, and bathing – especially in mathematics and physics. But each of these pathways to wonder is essentially the same: a moment of relaxed, mindful, reflection and contemplation in which we open ourselves to what we ordinarily do not see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two examples of that process. The first involves a story I heard several times while on trips with students, in the Amazon rainforest, in search of wonder. It’s a mythopoetic story about an ancient and colossal black caiman – a caiman is a kind of crocodile – whose body can be seen undulating across the night sky. You can see the body of the caiman between the bright bands of stars in the image below. Those stars are heroes and gods. The great caiman is surrounded by them and is locked in battle with them. The universe is held in tension by the forces of creation – represented by the gods and heroes – and the force of destruction, which is the caiman trying to swallow the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/3117623-Dark_Rift_2012_large.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dark Rift&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caiman’s mouth is forever trying to close upon and crush the universe, to draw it into its gullet and destroy everything. The heroes and gods are forever trying to prevent this fate, and the mythic cycle is sustained by this struggle. As it closes and is held open, the caiman’s mouth is at the center of this cosmic narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story, which involves the cultural practices of myth-making, is the result of people gazing upward, in the quiet night, and feeling wonder at the spectacle before them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use the same image for our second example. It involves astronomers who began, as children, with the experience of gazing at the night sky with wonder. Those early experiences led them into further gazing, with tools and machines, and to the same kinds of questions as our Amazonian friends: what is it, what does it mean, what can we know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have been gazing patiently at the galaxy for centuries. Recently they have discovered that a colossal black hole lies at the galactic center. You can find the location yourself: it lies near a group of stars called the teapot, which is near the lower right quadrant in the image above. If you imagine steam wafting from the top of the teapot, that steam is the galactic center. The black hole is hidden by a band of dark dust clouds that astronomers call the Great Rift. These clouds undulate across the spine of the Milky Way. The black hole, like the black caiman, might be thought of as a great, devouring monster. After all, the black hole lies precisely within the mouth of the caiman from our first story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both of these examples, our wonder leads us forward. What the cosmic tapestry is, what it means, and what we can know about it – all of this derives from the simple path of gazing with wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two examples are two sides of the experience of wonder, two perspectives from two different cultures. But in each of them, wonder drives the narrative. Wonder leads us to the big questions, connects us to ourselves and others, and provides pathways to meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently we experience many small wonders, piecemeal moments of fascination and distraction with which we fill our days. Recently, when I took my university students for a meandering walk in the forest, many of them said they had never experienced such stillness and quiet. It unsettled them, yet also helped them to feel more connected. That’s what moments of stillness and wonder do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonder is the beginning. It is often uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we fail to find such moments, we become lost, disconnected, isolated. We cannot discover meaning on paths without wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an educator I work with many young people who struggle with depression, anxiety, and the search for meaning. Most of them are involved in constant distracted activity that leaves no room for wonder. They become stuck in endless, frantic, fruitless activities that only lead them further from themselves. They are searching for a destination to which their frenetic lives cannot deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my addictions consulting I also encounter many people who are lost and wandering, searching for authentic wonder in digital worlds that cannot provide it. Those worlds are small wonders – fun and engaging to be sure – but they are not sustaining enough to offer greater purpose and meaning. Digital and virtual realities provide just enough small wonder, just enough immersive fascination to divert some people entirely. They become addicted to elsewhere worlds and substitute meanings. Their devotion to small wonder entails many sacrifices in daily life – particularly with social connections – and this process incrementally increases their isolation and distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, their access to authentic wonder is diminished. They experience no moments of relaxed meandering, no stillness, no wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is not restricted to the young and the vulnerable. It reaches into the very fabric of our always-on, ever-driven, exhausted cultures. Our big problems – climate change, global conflict, poverty – are connected to our small and individual problems, in the same way that the astronomer and the myth-maker are connected to the cosmos. In each case, wonder is the bridge that joins the personal to the universal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more wonder. We have enough small wonder already. We need authentic wonder: that feeling of deep mystery, connection, and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ongoing commitment to wonder might start with something simple: taking the time to slow down, to be mindful, to be open and curious; to choose small moments where we can practice finding wonder together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try that. Below is an image of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, in which there are roughly 3,000 galaxies. That’s about the same number of &lt;em&gt;galaxies&lt;/em&gt; as the stars we saw in the image at the beginning. The number of stars in this image is unfathomable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow yourself to experience this image for one minute, just a small sliver of your day, a tiny crack in which the universe is hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
