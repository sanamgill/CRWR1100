Find a partner to work with. It can be someone from the class or not; it's up to you. But either way, your partner should be someone who will not act like a jackass, or ridicule you, or do any number of unhelpful things to mess you up. Ideally, you are looking for someone who will take this seriously, help you explore it deeply, and support you in creating an authentically interesting product (kust like last week). Choosing the right partner is the most important factor in determining how this turns out. (This goes for life as well.) So, choose wisely.

### Getting Started

Ask your partner to make three movements. (Remember, the quality of this exercise depends on having the right partner. Choose someone who will make interesting movements!) Consider the three movements: how do they make you feel? What do they remind you of? What do they spark in your imagination?

Now, using one or more of these movements (you don't have to use all of them), write a short narrative that incorporates and builds upon the movement(s). You might write a fable, or another myth, or a remembered moment that one of the movements reminds you of. For an example of this latter approach, read [Fragile Movements](/education/creativity/2017/08/03/fragile-movements/). It's a short narrative (excerpted from [A Stone's Throw](https://www.rosslaird.com/stones-throw/)) about my experience of my uncle's careful hands. But, of course, the narrative ranges much wider, and speaks to universal aspects of my personal experience.

Do not feel that you must create a serious narrative (as in my example). If you like, write a humorous vignette, or a wry observation. It's up to you; the example is just to illustrate what I would do in this situation, not necessarily what you will do.

When you are done, read your narrative to your partner out loud. Discuss the process. Then, finally, think about how you might integrate this narrative into your composition. Add your notes and your narrative to your draft on GitHub. Commit the changes.
