Find a partner to work with. It can be someone from the class or not; it's up to you. But either way, your partner should be someone who will not act like a jackass, or ridicule you, or do any number of unhelpful things to mess you up. Ideally, you are looking for someone who will take this seriously, help you explore it deeply, and support you in creating an authentically interesting product (just like in previous weeks). Choosing the right partner is the most important factor in determining how this turns out. (This goes for life as well.) So, choose wisely.

### Getting Started

Ask your partner to take some time to consider carefully, then describe to you three images. They might be street scenes, family moments, objects of art, scenes from nature, or whatever. The possibilities here are very broad, and feel free to follow them wherever they lead.

Now choose one of the images and write a narrative about it. For an example of how you might approach this, please read [Windbreaker](/myth/2017/08/07/windbreaker/), excerpted from my upcoming book on addictions. It's a short narrative about a single image of a man standing on a street corner.

Add your narrative to your notes on GitHub. Commit the changes.
