title: Creative Activity for Week One
---

Opening yourself to the creative process is the most important step you can take in developing your capacity as a creative person. And the best way to facilitate this openness is to disrupt the regular routines of your life. So, the assignment for this week is to try something new. Here are a few suggestions:

* Go outside at dawn and go for a little walk.

* Go to a park and walk barefoot for a few minutes (be careful about ground hazards!).

* Explore an unknown part of your neighborhood (safely!).

* Try a new sport or activity.

* Try a new kind of cuisine.

For more insight on the importance of disrupting routines, read _Journey to Ixtlan_, by Carlos Castaneda. This book -- written by an author you've probably never heard of -- is one of the most influential books of the twentieth century. It has had a massive impact on popular culture and the consciousness of our age. I highly recommend you read it.

When you have completed this activity (it should take at least an hour), make some notes about your experience. These notes are just for you; their purpose is to help you keep track of your creativity as the semester evolves and as you start to think about your composition project. Add your notes to GitHub. Commit the changes.
