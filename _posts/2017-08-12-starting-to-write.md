Stop whatever else you are doing. Close your email application and
Facebook, turn off the background music, silence your cell phone. Put
it all away. Do it now. I’ll wait.

Sit in silence, without distraction, and read this post. Silence the
part of you that makes false claims about the utility of background
music or the necessity of leaving your cell phone turned on. Silence
the part of you that wants to argue with me, right now, about my
unreasonableness, the part of you that makes claims for this or that
distraction. Still the monkey mind that never shuts up, never stops
talking, never ceases inventing new ways to jostle, cajole,
argue. Stop arguing and listen: the voice of a writer can only be
found within silence.

Silence.

Start with that. Stay within it. Allow it to grow around you, to
blossom, to disclose the images and words that inhabit the landscape
of your inner life. Don’t control it, or direct the flow of that
nascent energy. Sit, and read, and watch yourself.

Forget that you are trying to write. This fact is irrelevant to the
creative process. It is a curiosity. A writer finds and follows the
creative voice. The means by which this happens, the structure in
which it unfolds, the particulars of the path: these are secondary and
inconsequential. A writer follows the path, whenever it appears and
wherever it leads.

A writer does not invent or create the writing. Instead, the act of
authentic writing leads the writer. Accordingly, the task of the
writer is to find – within – the stream, thread, and path of creative
energy. Writing inhabits its own life, is its own animal, is a being
struggling to be free of the cages we build around it. Don’t take my
word for it. Find the cage, find the animal.

Listen.

Stop arguing. Your arguments, like mine, only serve to strengthen the
cage. The animal of the creative is not swayed by our smartness, our
wit, our experiences. It does not care how many books we have read or
how many fancy words we know. It is not interested in our expertise
and the many ways in which we layer our insecurities one over the
other.

The animal of the creative wanders the landscape of gods and
heroes. The animal has seen things we no longer remember. The animal
is what we once were but have chosen to cage as a means of protecting
ourselves from the vastness of what we cannot grasp, the depths into
which we no longer dare to gaze.

The creative animal is primordial, eternal, wise beyond our
knowing. It has been waiting for us, all this time. Listen to what it
has to say.

Write.

Allow the creative animal to write for you one good word, or sentence,
or paragraph. Don’t mess up the writing. It is difficult to say what
this means, this messing up. Perhaps you are cool, or smart, or
erudite. Forget all that crap. It is meaningless. Write honestly. Let
the creative animal speak through you.

If, as you write, you start to worry about what people might think of
your writing, you may as well not start. Give it up now, before you
waste any more time. Or tell the part of you that wants to be a rabbit
rather than a wolf to shut the hell up.

Write something. Don’t worry about what genre it is. Genres have no
meaning. Writing — all writing — is, at heart, an extended negotiation
with the creative animal. That animal is partly you, yes; but is also
not you, is wholly an emissary of that mystery we run from and slide
toward.

And the animal is — for the most part — silent. Do not forget
this. Words are not the creative, cannot be the creative, will never
be the creative. They are echoes. Treat them as such. Find the source
of those echoes.

Find the cage. Find the animal.
