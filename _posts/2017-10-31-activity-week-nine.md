Find a partner to work with, as usual. Ask your partner to describe one memory.

Using this memory as if it were your own, describe it in a short narrative. (For examples of writing about memory, read [Grain of Truth](http://www.rosslaird.com/grain-of-truth/), which is filled with memories.)

When you are ready, consider how this narrative might be used in your composition for the class.
