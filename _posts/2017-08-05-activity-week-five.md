Choose a sound that has meaning for you (or is at least interesting to you). It might be the sound of a voice, or a machine, or one of the multitude of natural sounds. Whatever you choose, make sure that you have strong feelings about it.

Write a narrative about this sound, and post your narrative to this week's forum, as a new discussion topic.

(For an example of a narrative based on a sound, please read _Singing Bowl_, excerpted from my book [Labyrinth](https://www.rosslaird.com/grain-of-truth/)).
