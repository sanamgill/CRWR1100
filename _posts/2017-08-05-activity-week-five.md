Choose a sound that has meaning for you (or is at least interesting to you). It might be the sound of a voice, or a machine, or one of the multitude of natural sounds. Whatever you choose, make sure that you have strong feelings about it.

Write a narrative about this sound. For an example of a narrative based on a sound, please read [Singing Bowl](/education/creativity/2017/08/05/singing-bowl/), excerpted from my upcoming book on addictions.

Add your narrative to your draft on GitHub. Commit the changes.
