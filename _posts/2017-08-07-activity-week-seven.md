Find a partner to work with. It can be someone from the class or not; it's up to you. But either way, your partner should be someone who will not act like a jackass, or ridicule you, or do any number of unhelpful things to mess you up. Ideally, you are looking for someone who will take this seriously, help you explore it deeply, and support you in creating an authentically interesting product. You know the drill: choosing the right partner is the most important factor in determining how this turns out. (This goes for life as well.) So, choose wisely.

### Getting Started

Ask your partner to describe two smells and two tastes (with positive associations, ideally). Incorporating at least two of these smells and tastes (and other images of your own choosing), write a short narrative about anything you like.

For an example of one approach to smells and tastes, read [Gasoline](/addictions/2017/08/07/gasoline/), excerpted from my book Labyrinth.

Add your narrative to your notes on GitHub. Commit the changes.
