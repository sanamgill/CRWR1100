Choose an object that has meaning for you. It might be a talisman, a piece of jewelry, a stone from the beach, a gift from a loved one, or many other possibilities. Whatever you choose, make sure that you have strong feelings about it.

Write a narrative about the object, and then also write a reflection about your feelings toward the object. (For an example of a narrative based on an object, please read [The Jasper Queen](https://www.rosslaird.com/myth/creativity/2005/09/11/the-jasper-queen/)). Add your narrative and your reflections to your notes on GitHub. Commit the changes.
