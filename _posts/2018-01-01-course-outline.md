This course provides an opportunity for learners to deepen their creative process, to work on their inner development, and improve their writing. Learners are encouraged to take appropriate risks, to challenge themselves creatively -- especially when doing so provokes discomfort -- and to be open to personal and interpersonal process. The course involves many experiential activities and many moments of possible discovery.

The core focus of the course is on the development of self-knowledge, which is
the ultimate quest. Every creative tradition and cultural mythology affirms this fundamental truth. The path of self-knowledge is the most rewarding journey we can undertake, yet it is also the hardest. We are challenged by our family histories, by our cultures, by our own traumas and vulnerabilities. And yet we must persist, as all the old tales say, so that we discover the essential unity between ourselves and the cosmos. That's what creativity has always been about. At its heart, creativity is the path of illumination. No matter how much we apply modern attitudes to the creative process, that process inexorably guides us inward, toward a confrontation with our own consciousness and with the vast story of the universe. And that journey does not end: it simply tracks every more deeply into vast and unfathomable mysteries.

And so, whatever point learners find themselves in their own odysseys of self-discovery, this course encourages them to do some self-examination. All the great tales arise from the journey inward, and our own versions of that journey will be the source of our deepest and best creativity.

## Off We Go

Before going any farther, make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don't have one (or if you don't know), go [here](https://github.com/join). GitHub is free to join. Once you have signed up, come back to this page (you bookmarked it, right?) and continue reading below.

All of the course materials are on this page. Please read them. If you get stuck, open an issue using the `issues` tab in GitHub. (See below for instructions.) Also, please review the following online guides to GitHub:

#### Skill Development

Perhaps it’s most helpful to come at creativity in terms of a skill set. Thinking and acting creatively is really a matter of looking at the process of learning. Instead of focusing on the “content” we might ask questions about how we identify, interpret, create, and communicate this content. These are process questions. Below are some examples of the kinds of considerations we will explore during our process.

##### Creating a “Good” Question

The questions we ask tell us a lot about how we think, the assumptions we make and what we’re willing to accept as answers. What is a “good” question? How do questions emerge? Where do they come from? How does a creative question evolve? How do we hold space for our questions and how do they “work” on us? We will discuss these questions about questions, and see where they lead us.

##### Critical Thinking and Crap Detection

We are often quick to believe what we read and what we hear, especially when it comes from sources that we deem “authoritative.” Teachers, journal articles, media, books, professors, parents, and peers all have their own take on what is correct and true. Who is right? How do we know what we’re hearing is not false or misconstrued? What is true? From what perspective is it true? What other perspectives can be taken that are also true? What evidence is being used to support the claim? Is the evidence appropriate for the kind of claim being made? What ideologies, assumptions and beliefs are at play? How do they impact the interpretation of “facts”? And what are facts, anyway?

##### Finding, Using and Evaluating Resources

Resources are what we use to accomplish something. We have internal resources such as courage, empathy, compassion, self-awareness, mindfulness and so on to help us create, learn and work with the challenges of life. People in our lives such as teachers, peers, mentors, and guides also have skills, experience, and knowledge that can potentially help us accomplish our goals. As well, the internet, books and other sources of information are valuable resources. How do we know what resources we need to accomplish a goal? Are they internal, interpersonal, or codified? What are the means by which we access these resources? How do we know if the sources we’re accessing are good or the right ones for our goal? How do we evaluate their quality?

##### Communication (speaking, listening, writing, performing)

Language is expressed verbally and non-verbally in a particular relational context of culture, values and past experience. Our ability to translate ideas into words and actions, move an audience into a compelling dialogue, or simply be present to someone else, requires an awareness of these contexts and good communication skills. How does a mindful and embodied presence shape how we speak and listen? How do we write articulately, persuasively, and with accuracy and authenticity? How do our values shape the way we communicate?

##### Working in a Group

Groups offer invaluable opportunities for personal development and routinely transcend the efforts of any one individual. The following elements are some of the important capabilities required for healthy
group process:

* building trust and a culture of collaboration
* attending to individual needs and the needs of the group
* sharing responsibility
* giving and receiving feedback
* embracing and resolving minor conflicts

Much of our class time will be spent in small and large groups
exploring and developing these skills.

##### Following Through on a Process

Any creative process that generates new forms of knowledge (arts, sciences and otherwise) typically has a number of phases. These phases don’t always happen in order and are not necessarily distinct events, but it’s helpful to think about the eco-cycle of creative work. First, there is the discovery of interest or passion. The question or idea may not even be fully formed at this point, but there’s a spark that feels like it’s worth following. Next, we immerse ourselves in the topic. We read, have conversations, mess with different approaches. Basically, we commit to learning as much as we can about our passion. At some point we have consciously consumed as much as we can about the topic and we need a break from thinking about it. We let the questions incubate and trust that they are working under the surface in the dark soil. “Spring” eventually comes, perhaps after a long “winter”. Insights and breakthroughs emerge. Little shoots pop up out of the soil. We are careful to not jump to conclusions but instead create space for ideas and insights to slowly emerge through a process of articulating and capturing. In the last stages, we bring all the elements together in a creative synthesis and share the bounty of our harvest.

What is happening at each stage of the creative process? What are the challenges of each stage? How do we support the work that needs to be done in each phase? How do we manage our time in such a way that we are able to do creative work sustainably? Doing the preparatory work, looking for and taking opportunities, experimenting, being realistic about time, taking care of mind/body/heart/soul, and attending to other responsibilities all require good skills in managing our time. And how do we balance these various factors?

##### Self-Awareness and Self-Evaluation

Growing personally and professionally is a process that has no end point. Although growth is challenging and at times painful, growth is critical to finding meaning and vitality in our life and work. Living systems that come to an equilibrium with their environment — that stick with the status quo and are content living in their comfort zone — do not live for very long! For humans, growth requires self-evaluation, which in turn involves looking at our strengths and vulnerabilities, considering the evidence and feedback in these areas, identifying where we wish to grow, creating a game plan for how we plan to address our vulnerabilities, and celebrating our successes.

Self-assessment involves asking questions such about how we wish to grow. What is involved in growing in a given area? What opportunities can we find and/or create to grow? How do we take responsibility for working on ourselves? How does the feedback from others and the results of our attempts to develop tell us how we are doing? How do we decide what to do with the feedback we receive from others?

# How to Succeed in this Class

If you wish to achieve a good grade, please do the following:

* Show up for class – every class. This course depends on student
  engagement.
* Contribute consistently to the creative community and respond to the
  contributions of others.
* Take the initiative to plan and develop your composition. This
  course is (very likely) more fluid and organic than you are used
  to. Your ability to manage your time, commitment, and energy is
  crucial.
* Speak up in every class.
* Don’t look for the right answer to a question or challenge. Instead,
  find the answer that is meaningful to you.
* Ask for help if you need it. Open an issue if you need help (use the `Issues` tab).
* Commit to your project in a substantial way. Good projects take
  time. Rushed projects are obviously rushed.

Finally, please be attentive to the [KPU policies](https://www.kpu.ca/policies) on academic honesty and plagiarism.

# Attendance and Participation

The expectation is that you will attend all sessions and involve yourself in the class process. Your willingness to engage creatively with the learning process, to take appropriate personal risks, and to participate in group activities are all central to your involvement in this class. Because developing a style of authentic creative inquiry is very much a process of blending your own personal awareness with skills and practical techniques, your own emotional involvement in the class is as important as your academic knowledge of the material.

It's easy to identify those who possess exemplary interpersonal and creative skills. They are relaxed, open, responsive, and kind. Often they exhibit skills that we tend to assign to the social sphere: personal warmth, consideration of others, hesitancy to judge, sensitivity to emotions. In our class we focus on these interpersonal factors as a foundation for our experiences with one another. And we itemize them as features along the continuum of self-awareness:

* Commitment to the development of self-awareness.
* Openness to interpersonal process.
* Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.
* Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
* Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the class.
* Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
* Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.
* Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.
* Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.

Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item: self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:

* What am I feeling right now?
* What am I thinking right now?
* Why am I reacting in this particular way?
* What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?
* Is there anything about my current behavior that suggests unresolved themes in my life?
* Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?
* When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?
* In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?

These questions, and many others, require the capacity for self-reflection and self-awareness. As we continue in the course, you may wish to consider these questions as they apply to you.

# Asking for Help

## GitHub Issues

Sometimes you might need to ask questions outside of class (for example, when you are working on your document at home). There are two ways to ask for help: you can create an `issue` (see below) or you can [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/creative-writing-kpu/Lobby#). The simplest option is to create an issue. If a more organic, conversational approach is called for, your instructor will invite you to a gitter conversation.

### Creating an Issue

To create an issue, access the [GitHub website](www.github.com), and navigate to your repository. Select the `Issues` tab, then select `New Issue`. The new issue screen will provide a box for `title` and for `description`. 

* Title: should concisely summarize your question, (for example, "How could I create better atmosphere in my text"?). Please do not ask questions about subjects already covered in the course outline or which are easily searchable online. Your title should _not_ have a non-descriptive title such as "Question".

* Description: this should describe the issue you are facing, with enough information for your instructor to provide a solution. GitHub supports Markdown, which allows quick text formatting in issues. (See [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).)  You can also add a label to your issue if you want, but this is entirely optional.

You will need to _assign_ this issue to your instructor (Ross), who will get back to you as soon as possible. Under the `Assignees` tab to the right of the issue description, select the gear button; GitHub will suggest Ross as your assignee. Click Ross' username. If Ross' username is not immediately visible, just type "rosslaird" (without the quotes) into the Assignee box. You may aslo [mention](https://github.com/blog/821-mention-somebody-they-re-notified) Ross in the context of any issue, and he will be notified.

### Closing an issue

Ross will respond as soon as possible, either by requesting more information or providing an answer to your question. Sometimes, issues will not have a straightforward answer and will lead to _discussion_. This is an important part of the online development process and a vital tool for creative people working online. Once your question has been answered to your satisfaction, you can choose to close the issue, indicating it has been successfully resolved, by selecting the `close` button in the comment box.

## Assignment Feedback

You will need to decide whether you want written feedback on your assignments. Feedback can be very helpful, but not everyone wants (or reads, or responds to) feedback.  So, if you want written feedback, create an `issue` (using the instructions above) and ask for feedback. You may ask for feedback at any time during the course. If you would like specific feedback at a particular time (say, before or after a draft is due), open an issue with your questions at that time. If and when you ask for feedback, please be specific about the kind of feedback that would be most useful to you.

If you do not ask for written feedback, you will still receive a grade (of course) but you will _not_ receive any written feedback. 

# Readings and Resources

Please read Stephen King's book _On Writing_ and Robert Pirsig's _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_. Reading is a core task for the writer. But, more generally, try to use the hacker's approach in this class:

> You… have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity — 
> a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, 
> if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you’ll learn enough 
> to solve the next piece — and so on, until you’re done.
> --- <cite>Raymond, E. S. (2001). How to become a hacker.</cite>

# Your Assignment

This is a writing course. Accordingly, you will write a composition. The minimum length of your (final) composition should be in the neighborhood of 3,000 words. You will create this composition in several stages. You may write more than 3,000 words, if you like. There is no maximum.

Your composition should be a nonfiction narrative on any topic you choose. The goal is to choose a subject about which you are passionate and to write in a form and style that best further your creativity and your passions. The compositions will be discussed in detail in class.

This is the hard part: deciding what to write about. You must decide; your instructor won't assign a topic for you. The first step in authentic creativity involves getting a bit uncomfortable, and this kind of freedom in an academic setting is usually uncomfortable. Stick with the discomfort until something happens. We will discuss possible subjects in class, but you should begin this process with some self-reflection and rumination.

## Grades

The composition assignment will be completed in three stages (three drafts of the same document). You will simply continue to update your document with new and changed text, saving your changes using the GitHub `commit` mechanism (see below). As you write, you will edit your existing text as well as add new text (this is the essence of the writing process). Each commit is worth one point -- to a maximum of 25 points. However, in order to earn these 25 points, _you must make at least half as many deletions as additions_. In other words, you need to do some editing in addition to simply writing. You can see these numbers (deletions and additions) on GitHub in various places (such as the Contributors graph, under the Insights tab).

Each of the three drafts is also worth 25 points (see below for compositional criteria).

## The Composition Process

During the first week of the semester you will receive a link, via email, to a GitHub repository which will be your online space to work on your composition. You will write your composition on GitHub, saving your changes as you go.

#### Tip: Remember to bookmark your repository! You will be returning to it many times.

### Getting started

Click the link you received, via email, to your personal repository. Login to GitHub (if you haven't already) and open the repository. You will see a file called `draft.md`. Click on the file name to open it. You will see some sample text. Click the pencil icon above and to the right (beside the trashcan) to edit the file. (You can ignore the buttons that say Raw, Blame, and History.)

Edit your text using Markdown format (see [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as well as below). You can toggle between editing and previewing using the tabs at the top of the editing box (the `Preview changes` tab has an eye icon). When you have written a few sentences (or even less), scroll to the bottom of the screen where a green button says `Commit changes`. Don't click that button yet. First, add a comment in the small box; something like "I wrote a paragraph about cookies". Suggested text is provided in this box; feel free to use that.

In the larger box below, add an "optional extended description". You don't have to do this if you are committing (saving) only a sentence or two; but if you have added a significant chunk of text, you should say something about your process. Here are some possibilities:

* A note about how it's going overall
* A comment about how you are feeling about the composition
* A reminder to yourself about some aspect of the composition

Commit messages are an excellent way to track what you have done and why.

When you are ready to save your document, click the button that says `Commit`. Don't worry about the two small buttons that allow you to choose a branch. We won't be using those.

### Privacy 

Your repository is only accessible by you and your instructor.

### Using Markdown

Markdown is designed to be straightforward and simple. Normally you will just separate your paragraphs with one blank line (hit the `enter` key twice). For more complex formatting (headers, lists, links, and so on), take a look at the following guides and examples:

[Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/)

[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)

[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Line Wrapping

The default line wrapping method on GitHub is `soft wrap.` That's probably the best option. You can also choose `no wrap` to see how that works. Both options are available at the top of the editing box.

### Previewing Your Document Formatting

Every time you save (commit) your changes, or if you just view your document without editing it, GitHub will render your Markdown into HTML and show the document to you in your browser. This is an excellent way to check your formatting. You can also accomplish the same thing by clicking the `Preview changes` button (with an eye icon) whenever you are editing. Click `Edit file` to return to editing. 

### Editing and Saving

Edit your document in your browser window. Save the document often, by using the "Commit changes" box at the bottom. Every time you make a substantive save (when you "make a commit"), add a comment in both commit boxes. The top box is for a one-liner comment; the bottom box is for notes to yourself or explanations to your instructor. GitHub handily provides sample text for the top box. The bottom box is for keeping track of what you are thinking about or planning as you work on the document (as described previously).

### Each commit is worth one point!

Every time you make a commit, and if that commit reflects new or revised material (more than a single addition or deletion), you will receive one point. Please make at least 25 commits; doing so will earn you 25 points, which is the maximum number of points earned for this portion of the course. Remember that in order to earn these 25 points, _you must make at least half as many deletions as additions_. In other words, you need to do some editing in addition to simply writing. You can see these numbers (deletions and additions) on GitHub in various places (such as the `Contributors` graph, under the `Insights` tab).

You may find that you make more than 25 commits; that's fine. Make as many as you like. You will not earn any more points, but you may find that you track your document better. 
You can view your commit history and many other details about your activity inside your repository (as can your instructor) by clicking the `Insights` tab, then `Graphs`.

Normally you will commit to the `master` branch. You will see this option whenever you make a commit. You will also see another option, to create a new branch and make a `pull request`. We won't be using that feature, so you can safely ignore it. (But if you are curious, you can read the GitHub documentation for [branching](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).)

Whenever you have finished working on your document for the day, be sure to commit your final changes. Whenever you are ready to work again, open the url of your draft, open the editing screen, and continue along.

If you get stuck with any of this, ask for help by opening an issue (click the `issues` tab).

### Do not write in Word!

The main advantage of using GitHub is that it preserves the history of your document: all of your additions, changes, amendments, revisions, and so on. Each time you save (commit) your document, GitHub saves the history of your changes, and the instructor can browse those changes. This process is crucial to the instructor for giving feedback to you. If you work around the system (say, by coping and pasting from Word), your document will have no history, and the instructor will be unable to give you effective feedback (and a grade). So, please use the tools you have been asked to use. They may be unfamiliar now, but they are the basis of all writing online. You should know about them.

To give you a sense of how GitHub tracks activity on documents (files), you can look at the account page for any user. Your instructor's account page is [here](https://github.com/rosslaird).

### Commit Often

It helps. The more often you commit (say, after every paragraph or so), the easier it is to use GitHub's tools to traverse the history of your document. Remember that you should make at least 25 commits to your document in order to earn 25 points for this portion of the course.

### Adding Files

Feel free to add new files to the repository (for example, to create an outline or to collect notes). Don't create new drafts; use the `draft.md` file for all of your composition and editing. But if your creative impulse is to use more files to keep track of what you are doing, by all means do that (give new files an `.md` extension; that way, GitHub will identify them as Markdown files).

### Submitting Your Document for Review

You do not need to submit anything or to signal that your draft is ready for review. Just keep working and committing (saving). Ross will review your draft in the week following the due dates above and will give you feedback on GitHub directly (if you have asked for it; see the section on assignment feedback above).

### Assessment Criteria for the Creative Compositions

Projects for this course are focused on authentic and creative inquiry. Accordingly, the following criteria – which are based on the philosophy of creative inquiry – are used to evaluate engagement and commitment to the individual project:

* Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.
* Willingness to try new things, especially when doing so provokes discomfort.
* Openness to personal and interpersonal process.
* Willingness to collaborate with others.
* Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
* Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
* Ability to take personal responsibility and initiative for learning.
* Willingness to approach academic inquiry as a skill with discrete steps and standards.
* Commitment to improvement in writing and creative work.
* Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.

In addition to the above criteria, compositional criteria are also used to evaluate your writing, as follows (in percentages):

##### 80 − 100
Excellent: the use of language is pleasing and vigorous. The writing
invites reading; the work is well-crafted and grammatically
flawless. The author is perceptive.

##### 76 − 79
Very good: the use of language is generally correct. There may be a
need for further editing. This could be in the presentation of the
work (style, voice, characterisation, plot, point of view), or in the
language (diction, grammar, usage, spelling, punctuation) — but the
writing is involving.

##### 72 − 75
Good: the author has created a composition with substantial content
and without any serious errors in tone or narration. Problems with
creative shaping and delivery may occur, and there may be a further
need for learning the mechanics of language use, but generally, the
problems do not interfere with the reader’s appreciation of the work.

##### 68 − 71
Compositions with repeated errors in grammar, usage or punctuation
will result in a grade of no higher than 71 regardless of the
proficiency and imagination demonstrated in the creative aspects of
the work. On the other hand, compositions with no problems in grammar,
usage or punctuation may not receive a grade higher than 71 if they
fail to demonstrate an understanding of the challenges (of style or
voice, for example) involved in writing in the genre.

##### 64 − 67
Satisfactory: this writing shows constrained use of language (either
in the creative shaping and delivery of content or in repeated errors
in grammar punctuation, diction and usage), and the treatment of the
material has not resulted in sufficient depth. The writing is
potentially interesting, and a revision may improve the composition.

##### 60 − 63
This meets the minimum criteria of the assignment without in any way
exceeding it. There are repeated errors such as spelling mistakes,
sloppiness or a lack of depth to the writing.

##### 56 − 59
Below average: the writing is difficult to read because of
inappropriate delivery or repeated grammatical errors or
both. Furthermore, the idea may not be appropriate for the form. This
grade does not permit students to pursue another course for which the
graded course was a prerequisite.

##### 50 − 55
Fail: the author fails to understand the nature of creative writing or
has not tried.

# Due Dates

Compositions will be evaluated every month. The exact due dates are as follows:

| First Draft | Second Draft | Third Draft | Commits |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------- |
| January 31  | February 28  | March 31    | Ongoing |

## How to Submit a Draft?

You do not need to submit anything or to signal that your draft is ready for review. Just keep working and committing (saving). Ross will review your draft in the weeks following the due dates above and will give you feedback on GitHub directly.
