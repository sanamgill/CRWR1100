Find a partner to work with. It can be someone from the class or not; it's up to you. But either way, your partner should be someone who will not act like a jackass, or ridicule you, or do any number of unhelpful things to mess you up. Ideally, you are looking for someone who will take this seriously, help you explore it deeply, and support you in creating an authentically interesting product. A good partner in this exercise is someone who is has a strong identity, a positive growth orientation, an attitude of perseverance, good skills in self-assessment, strong self-management, and effective self-reflection. You want someone who is collaborative, shows good leadership and personal responsibility, and brings an attitude of empathy and ethical behavior.

Choosing the right partner is the most important factor in determining how this turns out. (This goes for life as well.) So, choose wisely.

### Getting Started

Ask your partner to take some time to think of three words. Do not tell your partner how these words will be used. You may, however, give your partner some guidance by suggesting that the words should perhaps be unusual or interesting in some way. Your partner can email or text these words to you, or they can speak them to you. It does not matter how you get the words.

Once your partner has provided you with the words, take a look at them and consider how they might be used. Now, using these words, along with words of your own (as many as you like) write a short myth. Take some time to get it just right. You must use all three of the words your partner has provided (but only once, if you prefer).

Remember, a myth is not just a made-up story. Myths are gateways to the universal. They are our personal dreams writ large onto the universal stage. Myths are the carriers of all wisdom, the narratives of deepest meaning, and the tales of greatest power. When writing your myth, consider options such as an origin story, a teaching story, a creation story, a story about the play of elemental forces in the world. Take the task seriously, as though you were the scribe for an ancient king and the quality of your tale will determine your fate (as in The Arabian Nights, in which the storyteller must prevent her own death by telling an engaging myth every night for a thousand and one nights).

Try not to re-tell a myth you already know (the neglected boy who becomes a wizard, the lost princess who finds her power, the wandering people of a post-apocalyptic age). Even though all myths are connected and share similar themes, try to make yours fresh and unique to you. Tell your myth in a personal way, perhaps as a vignette that recounts something that actually happened in your life. For an example of this approach, of what might be called a mythological moment, please read [The Bear: A Mythological Vignette](/education/creativity/2017/08/02/the-bear-a-mythological-vignette/) (excerpted from [A Stone's Throw](https://www.rosslaird.com/stones-throw/)). This vignette is probably longer than the narrative you will craft, but hopefully you will see that one approach to this exercise is to treat an event from your personal experience as a mythological event. That's what we're going for.

When you are done, read the myth outloud to your partner, then discuss the process. Think about ways you might use this narrative in your composition for the class. And, finally, add your myth composition to your draft on GitHub. Commit the changes.
