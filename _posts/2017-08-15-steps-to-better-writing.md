The oldest and greatest poems, epics, and songs – the original roots
and branches of all literature – are articulated visions. They are
dreams, glimpses of other worlds (real or imagined), archetypes of
clear seeing. This clarity of vision defines good literature, and is
therefore the ultimate aim of practicing writers. Yet various
impediments arise to obscure our sight, the way a bank of low-lying
cloud hides a shoreline glistening with pebbles. As writers, sometimes
we become disoriented by the many conflicting tools of our craft, by
contrary examples and advice, by the spinning compasses of style and
voice. Our path becomes uncertain, the shore distant, vision muddied.

And yet the shore is not far, and reaching it requires only a
steadfast purpose; and, of course, awareness of the fog. To dispel
that fog we must avoid its common traps, which are our own habits in
disguise. Below are the most common. Find them in your work, excise
them, clear your vision.

### Tip 1: Use concrete imagery

The writer is a ruminative animal (like a cow, in fact). We chew over
our lives and histories, we digest and express the stories to which we
are drawn. This process requires a good deal of thought. Writers think
– cogitate speculate, perambulate – and we write down our
thoughts. Yet we forget, often, that the reader does not have access
to our mind, does not perceive the interconnections and contexts which
lead us to our conclusions. We must show the reader that context, the
web of threads and images by which we derive our narratives. And this
requires that we replace our inner ruminations with concrete imagery.

On its own, unaccompanied by imagery, _I am sad_ is poor writing. The
reader is offered no means by which to understand the cause or nature
of the sadness. The writer must provide the path to understanding by
way of imagery. Typically, the rule for this situation involves four
or five concrete images for each internal rumination. Like so:

    Sheets of rain strike the window. I gaze into the dark, searching for
    the glimmer of proud trees across the field. Too dark to see
    anything. The house, empty now, twists and groans in the sidelong
    wind. Every whisper of its movement reminds me of the sad night ahead.

In the above passage, sad is embedded within imagery, layered,
integrated. It is not a rumination but a concrete indication of
feeling. And it comes in the last of five sentences, thus proving the
rule. This rule also has another name: Show, Don’t Tell.

### Tip 2: Use the present tense

Even when writing about the past, the present tense is usually the
best route to clarity. Other tenses and moods require more words,
encourage abstraction, and introduce a barrier between the immediacy
of the reader and the distance of the text. These problems are most
evident when writers use the subjunctive mood (or tense), which is
defined as follows:

    Subjunctive: a mood that represent an act or state (not as a fact but)
    as contingent or possible.

Strictly speaking, the subjunctive mood uses words such as _if, that,
though, lest, unless, except, until_ and so on. But in a more general
way, the subjunctive mood, or tense, might be described as any writing
that removes the reader from the concrete and present tense:

    I wish my dog were here.  If Dave were stronger, he would have been
    able to lift the tree stump.  If I had paid more attention to my
    instructor’s tips about creative writing, I would be a better writer.
    I requested that John be present at the wedding.

The above examples illustrate various ways in which subjunctive
approaches to writing introduce extra words and awkward
phrases. Replacing these with concrete phrases in the present tense
improves the writing:

    My dog is here.  Dave is not strong enough the lift the stump.  I
    listen to my creative writing instructor.  My writing improves.  John
    comes to the wedding.

Here is a short list of words and phrases that often accompany writing
that meanders away from the present tense and from concrete
imagery. Avoid these words and phrases whenever possible:

    there would/could, were/was, has/had, those/these, that/this

### Tip 3: Avoid adverbs and gerunds

A gerund is a noun formed from a verb: walking, for example. Gerunds
usually end in ing, and avoiding them is one of the single most
positive changes a writer can make. Gerunds are problematic for two
reasons: they encourage adverbs and they drift toward abstraction (see
tips one and two).

For example, a writer may describe a scene of walking as follows:

    I was walking down the street, quickly, not paying too much attention
    to the hurtling traffic and the shop-keepers shouting stridently from
    their stalls.

This vignette is neither in the present tense (and is therefore less
concrete than it might be) nor is it crisp and clear enough. As soon
as the writer begins with the gerund walking, all the other adverbs
and gerunds in the sentence follow naturally; awkwardly and
naturally. Gerunds, therefore, imply adverbs and abstraction. Also,
gerunds require more words and tenses: was walking requires two words
to state a simple verb. Here’s how to reduce the confusion:

    I walk down the street. My steps are quick, my attention wanders. I do
    not notice the hurtling traffic, nor the shouts of strident
    shop-keepers as I pass their stalls.

The revised passage is more immediate, possesses an air of expectation
(of suspense, almost), is constructed with precision, and contains no
extra words. The revision begins with a present tense action: I walk
down the street. The remainder of the passage builds naturally,
preserves the original clarity. Better. Stronger.

Like gerunds, adverbs – typically words that end in _ly_ – introduce
abstraction and encourage awkward phrasings. An adverb qualifies a
verb, limits or augments the verbal meaning. As such, an adverb serves
the same function as a bank of fog laid across a shoreline. The fog
obscures, mediates, filters. Almost always, adverbs may be replaced
with more accurate verbs and fewer words; as in the example above,
with the adverb quickly replaced by the verb quick and a concrete
image of the steps of the walker.

Gerunds and adverbs are not always avoidable. They are necessary at
times, and need not be shunned entirely. But often they are lazy
solutions. Avoid them whenever feasible.

### Tip 4: Tune your vocabulary

Writing is not speech. And yet the habits of speech tend to infiltrate
writing. Resist this whenever possible: look for these infiltrations,
replace them with narrative structures, preserve the clarity of your
vision. For example, I am not a farmer, and I do not eat broccoli is
better than I’m not a farmer, and I don’t eat broccoli. Apostrophes
derive from speech, and are usually to be avoided in writing (except
in the case of possessives, obviously). In similar fashion, it is best
to limit the use, in writing, of the following common and
conversational words:

    really, very, it, quite, real, some, somehow, someone, something,
    everything, thing, anyone, maybe, little, been, your, never, always,
    only, just, deep, people, about, being, guess

The vocabulary of a writer need not be coruscating or arcane or
hermetic. Small and common words will do, and in most cases should
do. Small words encourage precision and clarity. The order of such
words, the manner in which they are structured as narrative and not as
speech, determines much of the quality of writing.

### Tip 5: Know your habits

In addition to the various strategies outlined above, writers also
need to be aware of their individual proclivities: their habits of
laziness, their favorite and over-used words, the ways in which they
sacrifice clarity for muddiness. The following are the most common
secondary errors:

* Awkward phrase order in compound sentences
* Awkward shifts of scene or tense
* Awkward use of vocabulary
* Lack of clear narrative direction
* Stating the obvious rather than showing through imagery

These habits and their kin – the many pitfalls and hurdles that lie
along the path of writing – are avoided only through practice. Go
slow, review each sentence as you write, make a list of your common
errors and search for each error as you compose. Remember the primary
goal: clarity.

### Tip 6: Build Sentences Step by Step

Sometimes it’s easier to break things into manageable steps. Here are
some steps to consider in starting your compositions.

* Sit comfortably. Turn down thoughts. Relax. Enter into a
  contemplative mood.

* Consider what you are trying to express in the sentence you are
  about to write.

* Write the sentence. At this stage, don’t worry about details. Simply
  write.

* Review the sentence. Look for obvious problems, and find what you
  like most.

* Make sure your sentence contains the best words for what you are
  trying to say.

* Examine the phrase order. Look for a tighter order, more spare or
  visceral or elegant.

* Speak the sentence aloud. Find its rhythm and sonority. Tweak as
  required. Don’t rush.

* Take out all extra words and lazy phrasings, especially those that
  are habitual. Excise adverbs, gerunds, and verb phrases ("there
  is...", "I’ve done...", "We’re going...") whenever possible.

* Shorten the sentence if you can (without diminishing its meaning).

* Take a short break, gaze out the window, return to the sentence, and
  review it once more.

* Leave it alone. Build your next sentence.
