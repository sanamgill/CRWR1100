    Creative Writing 1200 is a course that explores the creative process. We
    examine — collaboratively, playfully, mindfully — the role of creativity
    in self-development, learning, community engagement, and writing. Using
    various creative approaches and practices, we follow the alchemy of
    creative expression across multiple domains.<br/>The class is taught by
    [Ross Laird](https://www.rosslaird.com) at [Kwantlen Polytechic
    University](https://www.kpu.ca).

    Hi, I’m Florian or @qwtel, which isn’t an acronym, I just wanted a
    short username and that one happened to be available.
